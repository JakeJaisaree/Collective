# Privacy Policy

**Disclaimer:** This policy covers data privacy. The suggestions generated by our GPT are for general well-being and experiential mapping and are not a substitute for professional medical, psychological, or psychiatric advice. If you have serious health concerns, please consult a qualified healthcare provider.

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Experiential Network App (“we,” “our,” or “us”). We’re dedicated to safeguarding your privacy while empowering you to build and analyze your own experiential network via our Google Sheets–backed service. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your data, and emphasizes that all algorithmic mappings are initiated and controlled by you.

## 2. Information We Collect

- **User Identifiers**
  - `user_id`: A unique identifier you choose or generate to manage your network.
- **Experiential Data**
  - **Nodes**: Each node’s type, quality (stress or content), energy level (1–5), and optional description.
  - **Connections**: Relationships between nodes, including action (“+” or “–”), weight, and context.
- **Metadata**
  - Creation and update timestamps for nodes and connections.
  - Logs of your function-call interactions with the Custom GPT interface.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Algorithmic Mapping Under Your Control**
  - Our proprietary in-house algorithm maps your inputs into a network and suggests balance interventions—but only when you invoke the corresponding function calls (`create_user_sheet`, `upsert_node`, etc.).
- **Real-Time Feedback**
  - We retrieve and analyze your network snapshot to provide stress vs. content ratios and personalized recommendations based solely on your data.
- **Service Improvement**
  - We may aggregate anonymized usage data to refine our in-house algorithms and enhance the overall experience.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Storage Location**
  - All data resides in Google Sheets under your Google account, accessible only via the service-account credential you configure.
- **Access Controls**
  - The `gsheets-creds.json` key file is stored securely on authorized servers and not exposed publicly.
- **Encryption**
  - We use TLS encryption for all data in transit between your client and our servers.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **Internal Use Only**
  - Only our application servers process your data to execute the functions you call.
- **No Third-Party Sales**
  - We do not sell, rent, or share your personal or experiential data with external parties, except if legally required.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access & Correction**
  - You can view and edit your network at any time in Google Sheets.
- **Deletion**
  - Deleting the corresponding spreadsheet in your Drive removes all your data; you may also request removal from the Registry sheet.
- **Opt-Out**
  - Cease making function calls to stop data collection entirely.

## 7. Retention

We retain your data indefinitely until you choose to delete it. Deletion is permanent and irreversible.

## 9. Updates to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in practices or regulations. We will post updates here and revise the "Last updated" date accordingly.
